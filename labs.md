# Working with HuggingFace
## Understanding the "GitHub" of LLMs: half-day workshop
## Session labs 
## Revision 1.6 - 10/23/24

**Follow the startup instructions in the README.md file IF NOT ALREADY DONE!**

**NOTE: To copy and paste in the codespace, you may need to use keyboard commands - CTRL-C and CTRL-V. Chrome may work best for this.**

**Lab 1 - Exploring Hugging Face**

**Purpose: In this lab, we'll start to get familiar with the Hugging Face platform and see how to run simple tasks using pre-trained models.**
</br></br></br>
1. In a browser, go to *https://huggingface.co/models*.
</br></br></br>
2. Let's search for another simple model to try out. In the search bar, enter the text *DialoGPT*. Look for and select the *microsoft/DialoGPT-medium* model. (Make sure not to select the *small* one.)
  ![model search](./images/hug48.png?raw=true "model search")
</br></br></br>
3. Let's see how we can quickly get up and running with this model. On the *Model Card* page for the *microsoft/DialoGPT-medium* model, if you scroll down, you'll see a *How to use* section with some code in it. Highlight that code and copy it so we can paste it in a file in our workspace.

![code to use model](./images/hug49.png?raw=true "code to use model")
</br></br></br>  
4. Switch back to your codespace. Create a new file named dgpt-med.py (or whatever you want to call it). Paste the code you copied from the model card page into the file. You can create the new file from the terminal using:

```bash
code dgpt-med.py
```
![adding code](./images/hug50.png?raw=true "adding code")
</br></br></br>
5. Save your file. Now you can run your file by invoking it with python. You'll see it start to download the files associated with the model. This will take a bit of time to run.
```bash
python dgpt-med.py
```
![running the model](./images/hug51.png?raw=true "running the model")
</br></br></br>
6. After the model loads, you'll see a *>> User:* prompt. You can enter a prompt or question here, and after some time, the model will provide a response.  **NOTE** This model is small and old and does not provide good responses usually or even ones that make sense. We are using it as a simple, quick demo only.

```python
>> User: <prompt here>
```
![running the model](./images/hug52.png?raw=true "running the model")
</br></br></br>
7. Let's now switch to a different model. Go back to the Hugging Face search and look for *phi3-vision*. Find and select the entry for *microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct*.
![finding the phi3-vision model](./images/hug53.png?raw=true "finding the phi3-vision model")
</br></br></br>
8. Switch to the *Files and versions* page to see the sizes of the files in the Git repository. Note the larger sizes of the model files themselves.
![examining the model files](./images/hug54.png?raw=true "examining the model files")
</br></br></br>
9. Now, let's see how we can try this model out with no setup on our part. Go back to the *Model card* tab, and scroll down to the *Resources and Technical Documentation* section. (This should be right after the *Model Summary* section.) Under that, select the entry for *Phi-3 on Azure AI Studio*.
![Invoking model on Azure AI Studio](./images/hug55.png?raw=true "Invoking the model on Azure AI Studio")
</br></br></br>
10. This will start up a separate browser instance of Azure AI Studio with the model loaded so you can query it. In the prompt area, enter in a prompt to have the AI describe a picture. You can upload one, enter the URL of one on the web, or use the example one suggested below. After you submit your prompt, the model should return a description of the photo. (If you get a response like *"Sorry I can't assist with that."*, refresh the page and try again.)
```
Describe the image at https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1364253107/photo/dog-and-cat-as-best-friends-looking-out-the-window-together.jpg?s=2048x2048&w=is&k=20&c=Do171m5e2DbPIlWDs1JfHn-g8Et_Hxb2AskHg4cRYY4=

</br></br>


**Lab 2 - Demonstrating how to use Hugging Face in programming**

**Purpose: In this lab, weâ€™ll construct a Python program that demonstrates how to use entities from HuggingFace.co to accomplish a meaningful task.**
</br></br></br>
1. In this lab, we'll create a program that performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews from the IMDb dataset and summarizes negative reviews. It leverages multiple features from Hugging Face, including the datasets library and pre-trained models from the transformers library. To start, create a new file for our code.

```bash
code lab2.py
```
</br></br></br>
2. First, import the necessary libraries from Hugging Face that we need. These are:
*datasets.load_dataset: Loads datasets hosted on HuggingFace.co.
*transformers.pipeline: Provides easy-to-use interfaces for various NLP tasks using pre-trained models.

Add the code below into the *lab2.py* file.

```python
# Import necessary libraries from Hugging Face
from datasets import load_dataset           # To load datasets from HuggingFace.co
from transformers import pipeline           # For easy inference using pre-trained models
```
</br></br></br>
3. Now, we load the IMDb dataset. (This is a widely used dataset for sentiment analysis tasks.) For purposes of the lab, we'll just select a sample of 10 reviews to look at. Add the code below.

```python
# Load the IMDb dataset from Hugging Face Datasets
# This dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative
imdb_dataset = load_dataset('imdb')

# Select a small sample of reviews for demonstration purposes
sample_reviews = imdb_dataset['test'].select(range(10))  # Selecting first 10 reviews
```
</br></br></br>
4. Now, we'll initialize two pipelines - one for sentiment analysis and one for summarization. The initialization calls will automatically download and load a pre-trained model that can be used for sentiment analysis or summarization, respectively.

```python

add the code to import the necessary models and pipelines. Put the following into the new file. In this code, the translator uses a pre-trained model for translating English to French (can be replaced for other languages). And the sentiment_analyzer is a pre-trained sentiment analysis model that works on English text.

```python
# Initialize a sentiment-analysis pipeline using a pre-trained model
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')

# Initialize a summarization pipeline using a pre-trained model
summarizer = pipeline('summarization')
```
</br></br></br>
5. Next, we'll add code to process the reviews. Here's what the sentiment analysis part does:

 - Sentiment Analysis:
   - We analyze the sentiment of each review.
   - We truncate the text to the first 512 tokens to adhere to model input limitations and improve performance.
   - The result is a dictionary containing the label ('POSITIVE' or 'NEGATIVE') and a confidence score.

Add the code below.

```python
# Iterate over the sample reviews and perform sentiment analysis and summarization
for idx, review in enumerate(sample_reviews):
    text = review['text']  # The review text
    # Perform sentiment analysis
    sentiment = sentiment_analyzer(text[:512])[0]  # Truncate text to 512 tokens for performance
    
    # Print the review index and predicted sentiment
    print(f"Review #{idx + 1} Sentiment: {sentiment['label']} (Score: {sentiment['score']:.4f})")
    
```

6. And, now add the code to do the summarization if the review is negative.
   
 - Conditional Summarization:
   - If a review is negative, we generate a summary of the review.
   - We truncate the text to the first 1024 tokens to prevent errors due to model input size limitations.
   - We specify max_length and min_length to control the length of the summary.
  
Add the code below with the printing of the results.

```python
# If the sentiment is negative, provide a summary of the review
    if sentiment['label'] == 'NEGATIVE':
        # Summarize the review text (truncate to 1024 tokens to avoid errors)
        summary = summarizer(text[:1024], max_length=50, min_length=25, do_sample=False)[0]['summary_text']
        print(f"Summary of Negative Review #{idx + 1}:")
        print(summary)
    
    print("-" * 80)  # Separator between reviews
```
</br></br></br>
7. Save your changes and run the file. After running it, you should see output for the first 10 reviews and summarizations for ones that are determined to be negative. Note that the first time you run it, it will download the required pre-trained models automatically from HuggingFace.co.

```
python lab2.py
```

![running the example](./images/hug57.png?raw=true "Running the example")

</br></br></br>
8. This example demonstrates several features from Hugging Face:
- Loading Datasets with datasets Library:
  - Showcasing how to load and manipulate datasets hosted on HuggingFace.co using the datasets library.
    
- Using Pre-trained Models with transformers Pipeline:
  - Demonstrating using pre-trained models for inference tasks like sentiment analysis and summarization, without deep diving into the model architectures.
    
- Combining Multiple NLP Tasks:
  - Performing both sentiment analysis and summarization, showing how to chain different NLP tasks together.
   
- Handling Model Input Limitations:
  - Illustrating how to manage input sizes (e.g., truncating text) to comply with model constraints.
   
- Customizing Pipeline Parameters:
  - Showing how to adjust parameters (like max_length, min_length, and do_sample) to control model output.

- Interpreting Model Outputs:
  - Parsing and using the outputs of the pipelines, such as extracting labels and confidence scores.

- Efficient Data Processing:
  - Using dataset selection and iteration to process and analyze data samples efficiently.

**Lab 3 - Publishing a custom pipeline on Hugging Face**

**Purpose: In this lab, weâ€™ll publish a custom pipeline onto Hugging Face**
</br></br></br>
1. Make sure you are logged in to your Hugging Face account. We need to have an access token to work with. Go to this URL: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens/new?tokenType=write to create a new token. (Alternatively, you can go to your user Settings, then select Access Tokens, then Create new token, and select Write for the token type.) Select a name for the token and then Create token.

![creating a new token](./images/hug29.png?raw=true "Creating a new token")
</br></br></br>
2. After you click the Create button, your new token will be displayed on the screen. Make sure to Copy it and save it somewhere you can get to it for the next steps. You will not be able to see it again.

![new token displayed](./images/hug30.png?raw=true "New token displayed")  
</br></br></br>
3. While we are in the Hugging Face site, go ahead and create a new repository for the custom pipeline. For simplicity, we'll use the Hugging Face CLI for this.  (If you'd rather know how to do it through the interface, see the alternate instructions further down.) Ignore the warning about *git lfs* and just hit *Enter* at the *Proceed?* prompt.

```
huggingface-cli repo create custom-pipe
```
![new repo ](./images/hug39.png?raw=true "New repo") 
</br></br></br>
(**Alternate method using the UI. Only do the option above or this one.**) Go to https://huggingface.co/new . (Alternatively, you can click on your profile icon in the top right corner and select New Model from the dropdown.) Then fill out the details of your model. You can just select "mit" for the license and keep the defaults for the remaining items. Then click on the "Create model" button at the bottom.

![creating new repo ](./images/hug36.png?raw=true "Creating new repo") 
![new repo ](./images/hug37.png?raw=true "New repo") 
</br></br></br>
4. Run the following command to login with your Hugging Face account credentials. Replace "*<YOUR_SAVED_TOKEN>*" with the actual value of the token you created in the earlier steps.  

```
huggingface-cli login --token <YOUR_SAVED_TOKEN>
```

![logging in with token](./images/hug38.png?raw=true "Logging in with token") 
</br></br></br>

6. After logging in, clone the repository down from Hugging Face to have it locally.

```
git clone https://huggingface.co/<username>/custom-pipe
cd custom-pipe
```
</br></br></br>
7. We have a custom pipeline that is coded as a Python class that translates English statements to French and does sentiment analysis on them. We're going to put this on Hugging Face. You can take a quick look at that file by clicking on [**extra/custom_pipeline.py**](.extra/custom_pipeline.py) or by entering the command below in the codespace's terminal.

```bash
code extra/custom_pipeline.py
```

8. As a best practice, we need to create some supporting files. Create a basic README.md file by running the first command below. Then paste in the remaining contents, **substituting in your Hugging Face username where appropriate** and save the file.

```
code README.md
```
```
---
license: mit
---
# Custom Translation-Sentiment Pipeline

This pipeline translates English text to French and performs sentiment analysis on the translated text.

## Usage:

git clone https://huggingface.co/<username>/custom-pipe

from custom_pipeline import TranslateAndSentimentPipeline()

pipeline = TranslateAndSentimentPipeline()
english_text = "I like this movie. It's pretty good."
result = pipeline(english_text)
print("Original Text:", result["original_text"])
print("Translated Text:", result["translated_text"])
print("Sentiment:", result["sentiment"])
```
</br></br></br>
9. Copy the custom pipeline file from the *extra* directory into the custom-pipe directory.

```
cp ../extra/custom_pipeline.py .
```
</br></br></br>
9. Now, we'll upload the readme and the app to the Hugging Face repository. We can do this with standard Git commands, but we can do it most easily with the CLI's *upload* command. Make sure you are in the directory with the app and README, then run the command below.

```
huggingface-cli upload custom-pipe .
```
After this runs, you should see output indicating your files were uploaded to the repository. 
![uploading](./images/hug40.png?raw=true "Uploading") 

You can also see the updated content in your Hugging Face repo.

![updated repo](./images/hug41.png?raw=true "Updated repo") 

10. Now if you or someone want to use the custom pipeline, you can clone down the repo (or use the *huggingface-cli download <username>/<model-repo>* command. Then you can use the example code in the README to try it out if you want.

</br></br>

**Lab 4 - Fine-tuning a model with datasets**

**Purpose: In this lab, weâ€™ll see how to fine tune a model with a dataset using the transformers library**
</br></br></br>
1. Create a new file named *lab4.py*. (Hint: You can use the command 'code lab4.py'.) In the new file, first import the necessary libraries for loading the model, tokenizer, dataset, and handling training with PyTorch
   
```python

import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from datasets import load_dataset
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
``` 
</br></br></br>
2. Now, let's load a portion of the GLUE SST-2 dataset for sentiment analysis. This dataset contains sentences labeled as positive or negative. We're only going to use a very small percentage of the dataset (1%) to make this runnable in the time we have, but it will be enough to show a difference.
   
```python

train_dataset = load_dataset('glue', 'sst2', split='train[:1%]')
test_dataset = load_dataset('glue', 'sst2', split='validation[:1%]')
```
</br></br></br>
3. This next section loads a pre-trained model and tokenizer named *DistilBERT*. The tokenizer is used to convert text into tokens, and the model is fine-tuned for sequence classification tasks (binary sentiment analysis in this case).

```python

model_name = 'distilbert-base-uncased'
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
```
</br></br></br>
4. Now, we'll create a function to preprocess the dataset. This set of code transforms the text into a numerical format that the model can understand. It adds padding and does truncation where needed to get to a consistent input size.

```python

def preprocess_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples['sentence'], truncation=True, padding='max_length', max_length=128)

tokenized_train = train_dataset.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)
tokenized_test = test_dataset.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)
```
</br></br></br>
5. We still need to convert the tokenized dataset into a format that PyTorch can understand and use. The code below accomplishes this, which is a crucial step for preparing our data to use for training and evaluation.
   
```python

tokenized_train.set_format('torch', columns=['input_ids', 'attention_mask', 'label'])
tokenized_test.set_format('torch', columns=['input_ids', 'attention_mask', 'label'])
```
</br></br></br>
6. Let's get a "before picture" by evaluating the model *before* fine-tuning. The eval is done by making predictions on the test dataset and calculating accuracy. This gives us a baseline for comparison.
   
```python

test_dataloader = DataLoader(tokenized_test, batch_size=16)

model.eval()

correct = 0
total = 0

for batch in test_dataloader:
    inputs = {'input_ids': batch['input_ids'], 'attention_mask': batch['attention_mask']}
    labels = batch['label']
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(**inputs)
    predictions = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)
    correct += (predictions == labels).sum().item()
    total += labels.size(0)

pre_fine_tune_accuracy = correct / total
print(f'Accuracy before fine-tuning: {pre_fine_tune_accuracy:.2f}')
```
</br></br></br>
7. The next set of code configures the training process with needed parameters. These include the number of epochs, batch size, logging settings, and output directory. The arguments define how the model is trained.
   
```python

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',
    num_train_epochs=1,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    logging_steps=10,
    logging_dir='./logs',
    eval_strategy='no',
    save_strategy='no',
    disable_tqdm=True,
)
```
</br></br></br>
8. Now we initialize the Hugging Face Trainer class. This simplifies the training loop and handles optimization, logging, etc.

```python

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_train,
)
```
</br></br></br>
9. Finally, we can run the fine-tuning process on the pre-trained model using the training dataset. Fine-tuning adapts the model to the specific task (in this case, sentiment classification on the SST-2 dataset).

```python

trainer.train()
```
</br></br></br>
10. Now, we re-evaluate the model after fine-tuning to measure the performance improvement. This is done again by  comparing predictions to actual labels and calculates the accuracy.

```python

model.eval()

correct = 0
total = 0

for batch in test_dataloader:
    inputs = {'input_ids': batch['input_ids'], 'attention_mask': batch['attention_mask']}
    labels = batch['label']
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(**inputs)
    predictions = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)
    correct += (predictions == labels).sum().item()
    total += labels.size(0)

post_fine_tune_accuracy = correct / total
print(f'Accuracy after fine-tuning: {post_fine_tune_accuracy:.2f}')
```
</br></br></br>
11. Finally, we want to display the accuracy before and after fine-tuning to quantify the performance improvement.

```python

print(f'Accuracy before fine-tuning: {pre_fine_tune_accuracy:.2f}')
print(f'Accuracy after fine-tuning: {post_fine_tune_accuracy:.2f}')
```
</br></br></br>
12. Save the file and execute the code to see the fine-tuning happen and the difference before and after. Remember we are only using a very small subset of the dataset, but we are also fine-tuning and testing with the same subset. This will take several minutes to run.

```
python lab4.py

**Lab 5 - Creating a Sentiment Analysis Web App using Hugging Face and Gradio**

**Purpose: In this lab, we'll create a web-based sentiment analysis application using Hugging Face transformers and Gradio. This app will analyze the sentiment of a given text and classify it as positive, neutral, or negative.**
</br></br></br>
1. Create a new file (suggested name *app.py*) and open it in the editor. Add the imports for the necessary libraries. These imports bring in the model processing and tokenizer from Hugging Face, tools for numerical calculations, and the Gradio library to build the web interface.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer, AutoConfig
import numpy as np
from scipy.special import softmax
import gradio as gr
```
</br></br></br>
2. Now, we need to define the pre-trained model path that we want to use for sentiment analysis. We use one which is specifically trained on Twitter data for classifying sentiments.

```python
model_path = "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest"
```
</br></br></br>
3. Next is loading the tokenizer from the pre-trained model. This converts the text input into a format the model can understand. It ultimately handles breaking sentences into tokens, padding, and converting tokens into numerical data.

```python
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
```
</br></br></br>
4. Load the model configuration that contains the parameters for the model. This includes elements such as the number of the classes for classification and the architecture details. This is helpful in getting the right settings in place for the model.

```python
config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(model_path)
```
</br></br></br>
5. And load the pre-trained model that will perform the sentiment classification.
```python
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_path)
```
</br></br></br>
6. Now we define the function that performs the sentiment analysis. It works by tokenizing the input text and processing it using the model to predict probabilitiies. The probabilities are then converted to the corresponding sentiment labels (Negative, Neutral, Positive).

```python
def sentiment_analysis(text):
    encoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')
    output = model(**encoded_input)
    scores_ = output[0][0].detach().numpy()
    scores_ = softmax(scores_)
    labels = ['Negative', 'Neutral', 'Positive']
    scores = {l: float(s) for (l, s) in zip(labels, scores_)}
    return scores
```
</br></br></br>
7. We're ready to create the Gradio web interface for the app. This creates the interface, connects the previous function to process the input and displays the sentiment as an output label.

```python
gradio_app = gr.Interface(
    theme=gr.themes.Base(),
    fn=sentiment_analysis,
    inputs=gr.Textbox(placeholder="Write your text here..."),
    outputs="label",
    examples=[
        ["I'm excited about the movie!"],
        ["The weather is great today."],
        ["That meeting was a total waste of time!"],
        ["I'm frustrated with the outcome."],
        ["That was an ok visit."],
        ["I'm could take it or leave it."]
    ],
    title='Sentiment Analysis App',
    description='This app classifies a sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative.'
)
```
</br></br></br>
8. Finally, we'll add code to launch the web app.

```python
gradio_app.launch(share=True)
```
</br></br></br>
9. Now, you're ready to test the app. Run the code below to start it. Then you can input sentences to test the sentiment analysis.

```
python app.py
```

10. After this starts running, you should see a line that says "Running on public URL: <URL>". You can go to that address and see the running app.

![public address](./images/hug42.png?raw=true "Public address") 

Alternatively, you can go to the PORTS tab in the codespace, find the row for the app, and click on the globe icon to open the application.
![open from codespace](./images/hug43.png?raw=true "Open from codespace") 
</br></br></br>
11. When the app is opened, you can click on one of the pre-populated examples or type your own in and click on *Submit* to see the sentiment result.

</p>
</br></br>

**Lab 6 - Sharing our app to Hugging Face Spaces**

**Purpose - In this lab, we'll share the Gradio app we created in the last lab to a Hugging Face Space**
</br></br></br>
1. Make sure you're signed in to your Hugging Face account. We'll use the Hugging Face CLI again to create a new Space to upload our Gradio app to. Run the command below from the codespace terminal.

```
huggingface-cli repo create  --type space --space_sdk gradio -y sentiment-analysis-app
```
After this, you'll be able to see a link for the new repo as well as other information.
![creating the space](./images/hug45.png?raw=true "Creating the space") 

If you want, you can open up that link and look at the empty space on huggingface.co.

2. Now, we're ready to clone down the new space area.
```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/sentiment-analysis-app
cd sentiment-analysis-app
```
There's also clone guidance on the website.  
![clone guidance](./images/hug26.png?raw=true "Clone guidance")  
</br></br></br>
5. Create a *requirements.txt* file with these contents and save it. (Hint: *code requirements.txt*, but make sure you're in the cloned directory.)

```
transformers
gradio
scipy
numpy
torch
```
</br></br></br>
6. Copy the *app.py* file from the last lab into the cloned directory. Add it and the *requirements.txt* file to Git and execute the commands from the dialog in your Codespace terminal to get the app put into Spaces.

```bash
cp ../app.py .
git add app.py requirements.txt
git commit -m "Add Gradio sentiment analysis app"
huggingface-cli upload --repo-type space sentiment-analysis-app .
```
</br></br></br>
7. Once pushed, the Hugging Face platform will automatically build and deploy your Gradio app. You can look at the build log on the site and monitor progress. The screenshot below shows the location of the button to look at the build logs for the app as it is building.
![viewing the build log](./images/hug46.png?raw=true "Viewing the build log") 
</br></br></br>
8. When the build process is complete and the ap is deployed, you can switch back to the "App" page to see your Gradio app live on the Hugging Face Space. Test it by entering some text in the input box and see the sentiment classification.
![app running in space](./images/hug47.png?raw=true "App running in space")
</br></br></br>
9. You can share the URL of your space. It's

```bash
https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/sentiment-analysis-app
```
